Technical Assignment: Monday.com Business Intelligence Agent
Problem Statement
Founders and executives need quick, accurate answers to business questions across multiple data sources. Currently, this requires:
Manually pulling data from monday.com boards
Cleaning inconsistent data formats
Querying information across multiple boards (work orders, deals, pipeline)
Creating ad-hoc analysis for each query
Dealing with missing data and incomplete records
The Challenge
Business data is messy. A founder asks "How's our pipeline looking for energy sector this quarter?" and someone needs to interpret that query, find relevant data across multiple boards, clean it, and provide meaningful insights
Your Task
Build an AI agent that can answer founder-level business intelligence queries by integrating with monday.com boards containing work orders and deals data.
Sample Data
You will receive two CSV files to import into monday.com:
Work Orders - Project execution data
Deals - Sales pipeline data
P.S - Import these into monday.com as separate boards. Set up appropriate column types and structure as you see fit.
Note: The data is real-world messy data - Your agent must handle this gracefully.
Core Features
Your agent must handle these areas:
1. Monday.com Integration
Connect to monday.com via MCP or API
Handle authentication and connection management
2. Data Resilience
Handle missing/null values gracefully
Normalize inconsistent date formats, naming conventions, text fields
Provide meaningful results even with incomplete data
Communicate data quality issues or caveats to the user
3. Query Understanding
Interpret founder-level business questions
Ask clarifying questions when needed
4. Business Intelligence
Answer queries about revenue, pipeline health, sectoral performance, operational metrics
Query across both boards when needed
Provide context and insights, not just raw numbers
Additional Requirement (optional)
"The agent should help prepare data for leadership updates"
How you interpret and implement this is up to you. Document your interpretation in your Decision Log.
Integration Requirements
Monday.com — Read only
Read: All data from both boards (Work Orders and Deals)
Use MCP or API — your choice
Important: Do not hardcode CSV data. Your agent must query monday.com dynamically.
Deliverables
1. Hosted Prototype (Required)
Working agent accessible via link
Platform of your choice
Must be testable without local setup
2. Decision Log (Required, 2 page max)
Key assumptions you made
Trade-offs chosen and why
What you'd do differently with more time
How you interpreted "leadership updates"
3. Source Code
ZIP file
README with architecture overview and setup instructions for monday.com configuration
Technical Expectations
Conversational Interface: The user will interact with your agent conversationally, handle that to the best of your (agents') ability
Monday.com Integration: Via MCP or API as specified above
Error Handling: Graceful handling of data quality issues and API failures
Tech Stack: Your choice — justify your decisions in the Decision Log
Timeline
6 hours
Questions?
If you have clarifying questions, document your assumptions and proceed. Part of the evaluation is seeing how you handle ambiguity and make decisions with incomplete information.

Good luck!
